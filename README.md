# FRC Team 8517 2025 Code Overview
## General
This code is a Java base for a FRC robot using a swerve drive. The code for the swerve drive is mostly custom code.
The code utilizes all CTRE motor controllers and Phoenix Pro. Nothing fancy in this code.
Changes to the base projects have been done to simplify the files for student understanding. This means files have been optimized and motor control has been minimized.

## Robot Overview
The base robot is our typical 3 wheel swerve drive system. Yes a swerve can easily be done with 3 wheels. 
Swerve drive power, speed and acceleration trade-offs are minimal with only 3 wheels when the robots weight is maintained.

## Current Code Structure
The code utilizes the Java Command Based programming framework.
